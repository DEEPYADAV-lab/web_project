## Repository:  web Designing Project 
*(Semester 2 â€“ BTech-MTech, CSE)*

This repository includes all my JavaScript projects from the second semester of the Web Development course. These small programs show how I used JavaScript to make websites interactive, using it alongside HTML and CSS.


## Introduction

This collection of projects helped me practice important front-end skills using JavaScript. The main goal was to learn how to add dynamic and interactive features to web pages.

Some of the key skills I learned include:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Changing HTML content or style using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** Making the page respond when users click, type, or submit forms.
- **Form Validation:** Checking user input before it's submitted.
- **Basic Logic and Algorithms:** Writing simple functions and conditionals to solve problems.
- **Interactive UI Elements:** Creating features like sliders, menus, and toggles.

## JavaScript Project List

Here are the projects included in this repository:

- **Alert on Page Load:** Shows a popup message when the page loads.
- **Button Color Change:** Changes button color when clicked.
- **Input and Data Types:** Takes user input and displays results using variables.
- **JavaScript Operators:** Uses math and logic operators for basic calculations.
- **Grade Calculator:** Gives a grade based on entered marks.
- **Multiplication Table:** Generates a multiplication table using loops.
- **Control Flow & Loops:** Demonstrates the use of `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` loops.
- **User Profile Form:** Captures and displays simple user details.
